Classify and say the type of Flower based on its features like sepals and petals length

The "Iris Flowers Classification" project uses machine learning algorithms to accurately classify different species of iris flowers based on their distinctive features.

Through data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, this project demonstrates how machine learning can effectively differentiate between iris species, providing valuable insights for botanists, horticulturists, and researchers. 

By automating the classification process, it streamlines flower identification and contributes to a deeper understanding of iris diversity and characteristics.
